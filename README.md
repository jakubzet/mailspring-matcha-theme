# Mailspring Matcha Theme
My adaptation of Matcha GTK theme suited for Mailspring.

The original Matcha theme is work of Vince - check his awesome piece of work in [Matcha GTK repository](https://github.com/vinceliuice/matcha). Kudos for the author for a wonderful theme and inspiration!

## Todo
Currently the theme is perfectly usable. However, for the 100% effect, there are few additional tweaks to be done:
- [x] Add base Matcha colors, components style and feeling
- [x] Add different color versions
- [x] Add screenshot
- [x] Add title bar buttons
- [x] Correct minor errors (scrollbars, inputs in preferences)
- [ ] Add dark background version
- [ ] Code cleaning
