# Mailspring Matcha Theme
My adaptation of Matcha GTK theme suited for Mailspring.

The original Matcha theme is work of Vince - check his awesome piece of work in [Matcha GTK repository](https://github.com/vinceliuice/matcha). Kudos for the author for a wonderful theme and inspiration!

## Todo
Currently the theme is perfectly usable. However, for the 100% effect, there are few additional tweaks to be done:
- [] Add different color versions
- [] Add dark background version
- [] Add screenshot
- [] Add title bar buttons
- [] Correct minor errors (scrollbars, inputs in preferences)
- [] Code cleaning
